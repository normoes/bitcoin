For running `bitcoind` or `bitcoin-cli` in a docker container.

In order to switch from user and password based authentication (using `-rpcuser` and `-rpcpassword`) to `-rpcauth` it is worth mentioning, that the docker image needs to be configured in a certain way (using environment variables):
* `RPC_AUTH` is set and is not `""`.
  - `-rpcauth=$RPC_AUTH` is used.
  - `RPC_USER` and `RPC_PASSWORD` are ignored, even if set.
* `RPC_AUTH` is not set or is `""` **and** `RPC_USER` **and** `RPC_PASSWORD` are set and are not `""`.
  - `-rpcuser=$RPC_USER` and `-rpcpassword=$rPC_PASSWORD` will be used.

A few more words about `-rpcauth`:
* Create a value for `-rpcauth` (`RPC_AUTH`):
  - Run the script `rpcauth.py` to create credentials.
  - The script can be found in the official bitcoin github repository:
  ```
      share/rpcauth/rpcauth.py
      # Also have a look at the README file
      share/rpcauth/README.md
  ```
  - The result will be a string in the following format:
    + `<username>:<salt>$<password_hmac>`
    + This is what `RPC_AUTH` is to be configured with.
  - Additionally you will get a `<password>` which is to be used to configure the clients connecting to the bitcoind RPC.
    + The `<password>` is used to create `<password_hmac>`.
